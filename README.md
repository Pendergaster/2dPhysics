## Welcome to simple 2dPhysics engine


This is physics engine with 2d boxes done as part of the school course. Nothing super serious , mainly done for education
Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Pendergaster/2dPhysics/tree/master/vsproject/3dTesting)
I used C as programming language and project is build as unity build.

#Short overview

Has rotaions and restitution. Pool allocator for bodies and quadtree as data structure.
Uses SAT(Seperating axis theorem) as collision check
