# **Welcome to simple 2dPhysics engine**


This is physics engine with 2d boxes done as part of the school course. Nothing super serious and mainly done for education.
Source code can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Pendergaster/2dPhysics/tree/master/vsproject/3dTesting)
I used C as programming language and project is build as unity build.

# Short overview

Physics has rotations and restitution. There is pool allocator for bodies and quadtree as a data structure for faster collision checking.
Uses SAT(Seperating axis theorem) for collision check.
